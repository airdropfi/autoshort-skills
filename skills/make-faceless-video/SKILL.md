name: make-faceless-video
description: Make a narrated, captioned faceless short video (AI images and AI voice) on the user's own AutoShort or StoryShort account. Works with either MCP server, detects which one is connected, agrees the script with the user, shows the credit price the server returns and renders only after an explicit yes, then polls the render and returns the video link. Use when the user wants to make, draft, render or publish a short video, YouTube Short, TikTok or Reel.
license: MIT
compatibility: Needs the AutoShort MCP server (https://autoshort.org/api/mcp) or the StoryShort MCP server (https://storyshort.app/api/mcp) connected and signed in. Rendering spends credits from the user's own account. Tool names are those the servers list; the skill never invents one.

# Make a faceless video (AutoShort or StoryShort)

You turn an idea into a short vertical video in four steps: idea, script, draft, render. Nothing is rendered or charged until the user has seen the script and the price and has said yes.

Two products offer the same kind of MCP server. Their tools differ, so this skill first finds out which one is connected, then follows the matching flow. Tool tables: [AutoShort](references/autoshort-tools.md), [StoryShort](references/storyshort-tools.md).

## Ground rules (both servers)

- Credits are the user's money. Never call a tool that renders or spends credits without an explicit yes to the exact price, given in this conversation. A yes to the script, or to an earlier question, is not approval to render.
- Every price, balance and limit you quote comes from tool output, worded as the server returned it. Never write a credit number from memory, never estimate one yourself, never convert credits to dollars unless a tool returned the dollars.
- Use only tools that your client actually lists. Never invent a tool name or a parameter. If a step needs a tool you do not have, say so and stop that step.
- Narration is read aloud word for word. Proofread it yourself before it is saved: spelling, numbers, names.
- Do not buy credits, set up auto-recharge, open a checkout or change spending limits for the user. If the balance is short, say so with the numbers the tools returned and let the user decide.
- Do not promise results. Never say or imply that a video will be monetised, go viral, earn money or reach a number of viewers. If the user asks for income or view guarantees, decline that part in one sentence and continue with the video.
- Content the servers refuse, you refuse too: real or famous people, lookalikes, brand logos and protected characters, sexual content, anything showing children's faces. For health, money or legal topics keep to general information and say so in the narration.
- If no matching server is connected, tell the user to connect one (step 0). You cannot sign in for them.

## 0. Which server is connected?

Look at your tool list. Clients often add a prefix such as `mcp__autoshort__`, so match on the tool name at the end.

| Tools you can see | Server | Follow |
|---|---|---|
| `autoshort_get_capabilities` and `autoshort_draft_video` | AutoShort | Flow A |
| `draft_video` and `render_draft` (no `autoshort_` prefix) | StoryShort | Flow B |
| Both sets | Both | Ask which account to use, with the decision table below. Do not mix tools of the two servers in one video. |
| Neither | None | Say: connect AutoShort (`https://autoshort.org/api/mcp`) or StoryShort (`https://storyshort.app/api/mcp`) as a remote MCP server in your client and sign in (OAuth, or an API key as a Bearer header). Stop. |

If a server is connected but its tools fail with an authentication error, relay the error and ask the user to sign in again. Do not retry in a loop.

### Which one fits the idea (decision)

| If the user wants | Use |
|---|---|
| A faceless short where you write the script scene by scene, with your own shot descriptions and exact narration | AutoShort |
| A multi-episode character series or short drama (season plan, character sheets, recurring cast) | AutoShort, with the `plan-a-video-series` skill |
| A product ad from a product page, a UGC-style app campaign, motion clips, own pictures in the video | AutoShort |
| Several platforms, spending caps for an agent key, webhooks | AutoShort |
| A narrated story video from a topic (scary stories, history, facts, motivation, Reddit-style stories) with a script the server writes and the user edits | StoryShort |
| A schedule that makes one story video every N days on a niche (autopilot series) | StoryShort |

Only one server is connected? Use it. Mention the other only if the user asks or the request clearly needs something the connected one lacks. Each server has its own account, credits and sign-in.

## Flow A: AutoShort

### A1. Idea

1. If you have not yet this session, call `autoshort_get_capabilities` (free). Use what it returns for limits, durations, languages and art styles. Do not hardcode them. `autoshort_list_options` (free) lists voices, art styles and durations with their prices when you need an exact enum.
2. Ask only for what you do not know: topic, audience, narration language, length. With only a topic, propose three hook-first angles of one line each and let the user pick.
3. Optional starting shapes: `autoshort_list_templates` (template gallery) and `autoshort_list_niches`.

### A2. Script

Write the script scene by scene and show it before saving anything:

| # | Narration (read aloud, verbatim) | Visual (what the viewer sees) |
|---|---|---|

- The first sentence is the hook: a real question, claim or tension, not a greeting.
- One idea per scene, short sentences, spoken language.
- Each visual is a concrete shot ("close-up of hands holding a coffee and a planner, morning light"), not a feeling.

Ask: "Want to change anything before I save it as a draft?" Apply edits, show the table again.

### A3. Draft (free)

1. Call `autoshort_draft_video` with `scenes[]` exactly as agreed, plus the language, art style, title and length the user chose. Saving a draft renders nothing and charges nothing.
2. Report what the tool returned: `draftId`, the scenes, estimated length, estimated credits and every entry in `warnings[]`. If a warning says the narration will not fit the requested length, show it and offer a fix.
3. Change a draft with `autoshort_update_draft`, then re-read with `autoshort_get_draft`. To change one scene of an already rendered video, `autoshort_revise_scene` creates a new draft; the original stays untouched.

### A4. Price, approval, render

1. Call `autoshort_estimate_cost` with `{ "draftId": "<the draft id>" }`, `autoshort_get_credit_balance` and, if the user runs an agent key with a daily cap, `autoshort_get_limits`. All are free.
2. Say it plainly with the numbers returned: "Rendering this draft will charge N credits. Your balance is M." Mention length, voice, language and art style. If `canAfford` or `withinDailyCap` is false, stop and report it (see "If the balance is short").
3. Ask: "Render it?" and wait for a clear yes.
4. On yes, call `autoshort_render_draft` once with the `draftId`. It is retry-safe: a repeat returns the first submission and does not charge twice.
5. Go to "Poll and deliver".

Shortcuts such as `autoshort_generate_video` or `autoshort_generate_chat_video` let AutoShort write the script. Use them only when the user wants no script review, and still run `autoshort_estimate_cost` with the same arguments and get a yes to that price before calling.

## Flow B: StoryShort

StoryShort writes the script from a topic. The user reviews and edits it before any credit is spent.

### B1. Idea

1. Ask for the topic (one subject, one angle), narration language and length. Call `list_niches` (free) when you need valid niche, art style and duration values; do not guess them. `get_credit_balance` (free) shows the balance and plan.
2. If the balance cannot pay a render, say so before drafting: `draft_video` needs a balance that can pay for a render.

### B2. Draft (free)

1. Call `draft_video` with the topic, optional title, duration, art style and language. It writes the script and scenes and returns `draftId`, each scene's narration and visual prompt, and the exact render price. It renders nothing and charges nothing. There is an hourly cap on drafts: if the tool says the cap is reached, relay it.
2. Show the scenes as the table from A2. Read the narration critically: facts, names, numbers, tone, hook.
3. Change it with `update_draft` (replaces all scenes; the narration you send is what is spoken) or `revise_scene` (one scene). Re-read with `get_draft`. These are free and only work before the render.
4. A draft the user abandons can be stopped with `cancel_video`. It is destructive, so ask first.

### B3. Price, approval, render

1. Take the price from `get_draft` (or the `draft_video` answer) and the balance from `get_credit_balance`.
2. Say it plainly with the returned numbers: "Rendering this draft will charge N credits (charged once, after the render succeeds). Your balance is M."
3. Ask: "Render it?" and wait for a clear yes.
4. On yes, call `render_draft` with the `draftId` and `confirmCredits` set to exactly the price the user approved. If you call it without `confirmCredits` it answers `QUOTE_REQUIRED` with the price instead of rendering; show that to the user and ask again. A price mismatch (`PRICE_CHANGED`) or a short balance (`INSUFFICIENT_CREDITS`) is refused with nothing charged: report it and re-ask.
5. Go to "Poll and deliver".

`create_video` enqueues a render straight from a topic with no review step, and it charges. Use it only if the user explicitly says they want no review, after you have shown the price from `get_credit_balance` or the tool description and received a yes.

AI motion clips: only if your tool list has `quote_video`. Call it first (free, read-only), show `baseCredits`, `motionCredits` and `totalCredits` as returned, get a yes to the total, then pass the same motion scene count to `create_video`. If `quote_video` is not in your tool list, motion clips are not available on this server: do not offer them.

## Poll and deliver (both servers)

1. The render is asynchronous. Poll `autoshort_get_video` (AutoShort) or `get_video` (StoryShort) with the video id every 20 to 30 seconds until the status is COMPLETED or FAILED. Tell the user it can take minutes; do not poll faster.
2. If the answer has a `blockedReason` or `blockedMessage`, stop polling and tell the user what it says.
3. COMPLETED: give them the video link the tool returned (the playable URL), the title, and the length if given. Remind them that AI made the images and the voice, so the platform's AI-content label should be switched on when they post.
4. FAILED: relay the message as written, then check the balance tool (`autoshort_get_credit_balance` or `get_credit_balance`) so you can say what the account shows. Never call render again on your own; offer to try again and ask first.

### If the balance is short

Say how many credits are needed and how many the account has, both from the tools. Do not call `autoshort_buy_credits`, `autoshort_setup_auto_recharge` or any checkout tool for the user. If they ask how to add credits: on AutoShort `autoshort_get_buy_credits_url` returns a checkout link for them to open and pay themselves; on StoryShort the refusal carries a top-up URL, or they can use the dashboard. You can also suggest a shorter draft and price it again.

## After the video (only if asked)

- Posting. AutoShort: `autoshort_list_social_accounts`, `autoshort_get_connection_status`, then `autoshort_publish_video`. StoryShort: `list_social_accounts`, `get_connection_status`, then `publish_video` (YouTube, or the creator's TikTok Drafts with `userConsent: true` only after the user agreed). Post only when the user asks, to the platform they name, and say what the tool says about drafts versus public posts. Ask the kids-audience (COPPA) question for YouTube; do not guess it.
- Past videos: `autoshort_list_videos` / `list_videos`, and `autoshort_get_video` / `get_video`. A video that has not started rendering can be cancelled with `autoshort_cancel_video` / `cancel_video`; both refuse once rendering has started and ask the user to confirm first.
- Series and schedules are separate: for a multi-episode story use the `plan-a-video-series` skill. Do not create series, schedules or webhooks unless asked.

## What you can say about the product

Both products make faceless shorts: AI-generated images (or, on AutoShort, the user's own pictures), a narration voice and captions, assembled into a vertical video. Describe what the video is, not how it will perform.
